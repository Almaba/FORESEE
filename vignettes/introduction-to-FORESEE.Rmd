## Introduction {#introduction}

uniFied translatiOnal dRug rESponsE prEdiction platform FORESEE is a versatile open source software, implemented as R-package, that is designed to act as a scaffold in developing and benchmarking such computational drug response models. FORESEE not only introduces a uniform data format for public cell line and patient data sets, but also establishes a standardized environment for drug response prediction pipelines, incorporating state of the art preprocessing methods, model training algorithms and different validation techniques. A modular implementation of the different elements of the modeling pipeline facilitates a straightforward development of different combinatorial models, which can be used to re-evaluate and improve already existing modeling pipelines, as well as to develop and benchmark new ones.

We recommend to install <a href="https://github.com/JRC-COMBINE/FORESEEData">FORESEEData</a> package alongside this package.


## Installation Instructions

## Use Cases
### 1. Evaluating Different Options for a Specific Step of the FORESEE Pipeline (Here: Blackbox Algorithm)

In order to investigate the different algorithms that are already implemented to train a drug response model, we can use the function *listInputOptions*.

```r
require(FORESEE)
algorithm_options <- listInputOptions("BlackBoxFilter")
```
Since for this use case, we do not want to test a user-defined function, but only compare already implemented functions, we exclude that option from our list. 
```r
algorithm_options <- algorithm_options[algorithm_options != "User Defined Function"]
```
Moreover, we want to restrict our analysis to gene expression data only. Thus, we exclude the option *tandem* from our list, as it requires not only gene expression data, but at least one other molecular data type. 
```r
algorithm_options <- algorithm_options[algorithm_options != "tandem"]
```
In a next step, we can now run the FORESEE pipeline, looping through the different options in our list. As an example, we use the cell line data set GDSC [@Garnett2012] for training the model and the breast cancer patient data set GSE6434 [@Chang2005] for testing the model.

```r
roc_auc <- c()

# Loop
for (i in 1:length(algorithm_options)){

# Train a model on GDSC cell line data
ForeseeTrain(TrainObject=GDSC, TestObject=GSE6434, DrugName="Docetaxel", CellResponseType = "IC50", CellResponseTransformation = "none", InputDataTypes = "GeneExpression", TrainingTissue = "all", TestingTissue = "all", DuplicationHandling = "first", HomogenizationMethod = "ComBat",GeneFilter = "variance", FeaturePreprocessing = "none", BlackBox = algorithm_options[i], nfoldCrossvalidation = 1)

# Test the model on GSE6434 patient data
ForeseeTest(TestObject=TestObject, ForeseeModel=ForeseeModel, Evaluation = "rocauc", BlackBox = algorithm_options[i])

# Collect auc of roc curve as performance measure in a list
roc_auc[i] <-  Performance
}
```
To get an overview of the performances of the different algorithm options, we can plot the result in a diagram.

```r
# Plot the results
plot(roc_auc, xlab = "Black Box Algorithm", ylab = "AUC of ROC", xaxt='n',main="Performance of Predicting Drug Sensitivity \nin GSE6434 Patients Using GDSC Data for Training")
axis(1, at=1:7, labels=algorithm_options)
```

### 2. Comparing Modeling Performance of a Specific Pipeline on Different Data Sets
In order to check for the stability of a model's performance, it can be interesting apply the same pipeline of preprocessing and processing methods to different data sets. Since both, the data set by Daemen et al. [@Daemen2013] and the GDSC data set [@Garnett2012], are well-known cell line data sets that contain data for Docetaxel, we chose these to be the two different training data sets to train our model that is then tested on the breast cancer patient data set GSE6434 [@Chang2005]. 

We start with the GDSC data set, which provides IC50 values as drug sensitivity measure.

```r
require(FORESEE)
require(pROC)

ForeseeTrain(TrainObject=GDSC, TestObject=GSE6434, DrugName="Docetaxel", CellResponseType = "IC50",
             CellResponseTransformation = "none", InputDataTypes = "GeneExpression", TrainingTissue = "all",
             TestingTissue = "all", DuplicationHandling = "first", HomogenizationMethod = "ComBat",GeneFilter = "variance",
             FeaturePreprocessing = "none", BlackBox = "rf_ranger", nfoldCrossvalidation = 1)

# Apply the trained model to patient data             
Foreseen<- Foreseer(TestObject=TestObject, ForeseeModel=ForeseeModel, BlackBox = "rf_ranger")
ROCObj_GDSC <- pROC::roc(-(as.numeric(TestObject$Annotation)), Foreseen, direction="<", auc=TRUE)
rocauc_GDSC <-ROCObj_GDSC$auc
```

Next, we use almost the same routine for the data set published by Daemen et al.. In order to investigate which drug sensitivity measures are available, we call: 

```r
DAEMEN$ResponseTypes
```
Since GI50 values are the only response measure available, we choose them for *CellResponseType* instead of IC50 values. 

```r

ForeseeTrain(TrainObject=DAEMEN, TestObject=GSE6434, DrugName="Docetaxel", CellResponseType = "GI50",
             CellResponseTransformation = "none", InputDataTypes = "GeneExpression", TrainingTissue = "all",
             TestingTissue = "all", DuplicationHandling = "first", HomogenizationMethod = "ComBat",
             GeneFilter = "variance", FeaturePreprocessing = "none", BlackBox = "rf_ranger", nfoldCrossvalidation = 1)
             
# Apply the trained model to patient data 
Foreseen<- Foreseer(TestObject=TestObject, ForeseeModel=ForeseeModel, BlackBox = "rf_ranger")
ROCObj_DAEMEN <- pROC::roc(-(as.numeric(TestObject$Annotation)), Foreseen, direction="<", auc=TRUE)
rocauc_DAEMEN <-ROCObj_DAEMEN$auc

```
When we plot both of the ROC curves, we can see that for this specific set of parameters and methods, a model trained on GDSC data is performing better than a model trained on the data by Daemen et al.. 

```r
plot.roc(ROCObj_GDSC, legacy.axes = TRUE, print.auc=TRUE, main = "GDSC")
plot.roc(ROCObj_DAEMEN, legacy.axes = TRUE, print.auc=TRUE, main = "Daemen et al.")

```

<img src="./Example2_GDSC.jpeg" width="300px" />
<img src="./Example2_DAEMEN.jpeg" width="300px" />

One possible cause for this significant difference in performance is the limited amount of samples in the training set by Daemen et al. (42 cell line samples with Docetaxel response) in comparison to the GDSC data set (836 cell line samples with Docetaxel response). Moreover, the overlap of features (genes) between training and test objects (after homogenization and variance filtering) is a lot larger for the combination of GDSC and GSE6434 (6347 genes) than for the combination of the data by Daemen et al. and GSE6434 (523 genes). A more detailed interpretation and explanation however is beyond the scope of this use case.

### 3. Using Sample Information to Customize the Training Set

The functional element *SampleSelector* uses tissue site descriptions that are contained in the ForeseeCell object in order to restrict the training to samples with a certain tissue of origin, for example *lung*:

```r
require(FORESEE)
ForeseeTrain(TrainObject=GDSC, TestObject=GSE6434, DrugName="Docetaxel", CellResponseType = "IC50",
             CellResponseTransformation = "none", InputDataTypes = "GeneExpression", TrainingTissue = "lung",
             TestingTissue = "all", DuplicationHandling = "first", HomogenizationMethod = "ComBat",GeneFilter = "variance",
             FeaturePreprocessing = "none", BlackBox = "linear", nfoldCrossvalidation = 1)

# Apply the trained model to patient data             
Foreseen<- Foreseer(TestObject=TestObject, ForeseeModel=ForeseeModel, BlackBox = "linear")
require(pROC)
ROCObj <- pROC::roc(-(as.numeric(TestObject$Annotation)), Foreseen)
plot.roc(ROCObj, legacy.axes = TRUE, print.auc=TRUE, main = "Training Tissue: Lung")

```
<img src="./Example3_TrainingTissueLung.jpeg" width="400px" />

However, often there is more detailed information on the samples within the data files that remains unused, if only the *SampleSelector* is used for specification. This information can still be used, if the user preprocesses the ForeseeCell Object before the analysis.

In order to get an overview of what information is available for the GDSC object, we can investigate the meta information:
```r
colnames(GDSC$TissueInfo)
```
Consequently, we can also filter the samples according to their Histology. In this example, we choose *carcinoma*:

```r
require(FORESEE)
GDSC_carcinoma <- GDSC

# Find all cell lines that are carcinomas
GDSC_carcinomacells <-GDSC$TissueInfo$Line[GDSC$TissueInfo$Histology=="carcinoma"]
# Restrict the GDSC_carcinoma object to those cell lines only
GDSC_carcinoma$GeneExpression <-GDSC_carcinoma$GeneExpression[,colnames(GDSC$GeneExpression) %in% GDSC_carcinomacells]
```
Now we can run the regular pipeline. We choose "all" for *TrainingTissue* to include all carcinoma samples we just collected:

```r
ForeseeTrain(TrainObject=GDSC_carcinoma, TestObject=GSE6434, DrugName="Docetaxel", CellResponseType = "IC50",
             CellResponseTransformation = "none", InputDataTypes = "GeneExpression", TrainingTissue = "all",
             TestingTissue = "all", DuplicationHandling = "first", HomogenizationMethod = "ComBat",GeneFilter = "variance",
             FeaturePreprocessing = "none", BlackBox = "linear", nfoldCrossvalidation = 1)

# Apply the trained model to patient data             
Foreseen<- Foreseer(TestObject=TestObject, ForeseeModel=ForeseeModel, BlackBox = "linear")
require(pROC)
ROCObj <- pROC::roc(-(as.numeric(TestObject$Annotation)), Foreseen)
plot.roc(ROCObj, legacy.axes = TRUE, print.auc=TRUE, main = "Training Histology: Carcinoma")

```

### 4. Integrating User-defined Functions into the FORESEE Pipeline
FORESEE is designed to be easily expandable. While there are numerous different pipelines 
already implemented in the package, the user can conveniently change each part of the pipeline 
with their own method. To be exact, within ForeseeTrain, CellResponseTransformation, DuplicationHandling,
HomogenizationMethod, GeneFilter, FeaturePreprocessing and BlackBox can be defined by the user. In this
section we demonstrate this capability of FORESEE through some examples.

#### User-defined CellResponseTransformation:
The underlying distribution of 'Response' has a great impact on the fitted model using a blackbox. Here,
the 'Response' is the cell line response to a drug, quantified by different measures, e.g. IC50. The 
measured IC50s are not necessarily distributed for an optimum model fitiing, so it is quite common in
preprocessing stage to 'transform' these Response values, for example by power transforming or changing 
to logarithmic scale, which are already implemented in FORESEE and can be easily used by CellResponseTransformation="powertransform" and CellResponseTransformation="logarithm" respectively.

But It is possible to implement your own transformation and pass your function 
CellResponseTransformation=User_Transformation to be used in the FORESEE pipeline.

FORESEE expects your transformation to be function which has one vector of numerics as input, and returns
one vector of numerics.

As an example, we implement a transformation that uniforms the Response and use it in FORESEE:
```r
Uniformer <- function(x){
    sort(runif(n = length(x), min = min(x), max = max(x)))[rank(x)]
}
```

Now we just have to pass Uniformer function to ForeseeTrain as the CellResponseTransformation:
```r
EnvForRunningUniformer <- new.env()
EnvForRunningUniformer$Uniformer <- Uniformer()
tmp <- with(EnvForRunningUniformer, {ForeseeTrain(TrainObject = GDSC,
                                                TestObject = GSE6434, DrugName = "Docetaxel",
                                                DuplicationHandling = "first", GeneFilter = "variance",
                                                CellResponseTransformation = Uniformer);
  ForeseeTest(TestObject = TestObject, ForeseeModel = ForeseeModel)}
)
```
