# FORESEE: a Tool for the Systematic Comparison of Translational Drug Response Modeling Pipelines


Getting started with git:

1- https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/learn-git-in-30-minutes -> fast and easy, contains all necessary things, we won't use anything more complicated that what they covered

2- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 -> Text book for git, for more detailed explanation, not really necessary unless your interested

Getting started with R-package development:

I don't think we need to learn anything as long as you use RSTUDIO, so you can just clone this repository, open it as a project in RSTUDIO, and add .R files with new functions you implemented in R folder, just like the hello.R example, and add corrsiponding documents to man folder
