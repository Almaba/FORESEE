\usage{
SampleSelector(TrainObject, TrainingTissue, InputDataTypes)
}
\arguments{
\item{TrainObject}{Object that contains all data needed to train a model, such as gene expression, mutation, copy number variation, methylation, cancer type, drug response data, etc.}

\item{TrainingTissue}{Tissue type that the cell lines of the TrainObject should be of, such as skin or lung. Default should be "all" for pancancer analysis.}

\item{InputDataTypes}{Data types of the TrainObject that are to be used to train the model, such as gene expression, mutation, copy number variation, methylation, cancer type, drug response data, etc.}
}
\value{
\item{TrainObject}{The TrainObject with only those samples that have a specified drug response and are available for all chosen input data types.}
}
\description{
The Sample Selector returns features of only those samples that have a specified drug response and are available for all chosen input data types. If a specific tissue is selected, the samples are reduced to cell lines of that tissue only.
